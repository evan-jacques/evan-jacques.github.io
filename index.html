  			I am a young Software Developer living and working on Vancouver Island. I am currently employed with an international scale producer of lumber industry equipment. In my role I use C++ in helping to develop and debug the optimization and scanning software used by wood products producing companies all around the world.
  			</p>
  			<p class="cover">
			Before that I was a student at McGill University where I studied Computer Science. In my final year I also had the privilege of working with the Network Dynamics research lab where we used Python as a tool to see what social media can tell us about the human condition.
			</p>
			<p class="cover">
			In my spare time I play high level competitive soccer as well as work on my own personal projects, which currently includes a mobile for a Richmond based company.
			</p>
			<p class="cover">
			In addition to Computer Science, my degree from McGill includes  a second major in Biology and some business courses. I believe this broadens my view in applying computer solutions to real world issues.   I have traveled extensively in western and eastern Europe and speak French fluently which I believe helps me maintain a global perspective on the technology industry.

  						<dt class="edu-5">Developed optimization software that pairs with USNRs wood processing machinery</dd>
  						<dd class="edu-7"> - Part of a team that designed and implemented the software that is paired with new machinery being developed</dd>
  						<dd class="edu-6"> > Created a new machine type that is different than USNRs other products as it provides simpler, pattern based solutions but at a much faster speed and cheaper cost.</dd>
  						<dd class="edu-6"> > Used the Pimpl idiom to separate the internal implementation from potential users.</dd>
              <dd class="edu-6"> > Designed the user interface to be more intuitive and easy to use while maintaining the feature completeness of the machinery it pairs with.</dd>
  						<dd class="edu-6"> > Implemented the software with an emphasis on speed and space efficiency.</dd>
  						<dd class="edu-7"> - Added features to our software to accommodate changes and upgrades to existing machinery</dd>
  						<dd class="edu-6"> > Took two vastly different techniques for aligning materials and combined them to create a more accurate and more reliable method.</dd>
              <dd class="edu-6"> > Implemented a new technique used to validate the proper shape of materials.</dd>
              <dd class="edu-6"> > Reorganized and implemented the user interface on one machine which allows base users more access to different features.</dd>
  						<dd class="edu-7"> - Navigated an extremely large code base developed over 20 years to find and fix bugs.</dd>
  						<dd class="edu-6"> > Used breakpoints and stepped through the code to find specific errors after narrowing down the location of the problem.</dd>
  						<dd class="edu-6"> > Used the Wolf fence algorithm to track specific changes causing performance losses.</dd>
